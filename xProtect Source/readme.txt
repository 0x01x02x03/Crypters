make new EMPTY console project in VS2008 (any other should work), put .cpp .h files in the folder they're supposed to be in
drag & drop/add the .cpp .h files onto the project
compile in VS2008 in release mode with settings from sample_settings.png

adjust modifiers in build.cpp in case of entropy detections
any API called in stub needs to be imported dynamically
